# Web_API_Homework

This assignment was inspired from another programmer online. 
Breaking down all of the pages for each specific criteria helped keep my code organzied, manageable and easy to navigate.
I made it easy to adjust the time frames in the Javascriptk if you wanted more of a challenge.
I played around in CSS alot and familiarized myself with some other parameters used in CSS.
I added alot of hover functions and buttons in the game. 
I have random 3 questions that I found and added in.
